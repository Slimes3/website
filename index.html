        <p id ="bio" ><img src = "Images/biopic.png" alt = "Portrait with my dog Cali and I."> Hi, my name is Adam Dressel, welcome to my website. I am a software engineering student at Florida Gulf Coast University and an aspiring software developer. I live at home with my parents and my cute little dog Cali. I am looking forward to developing by skills as a programmer and design architect. In my spare time I love to play games and watch tv with friends, work on personal projects and play pickup basketball. I believe my communication skills and experience will make me a great asset to your development team, and I hope to get into contact with other inspired creators. </p>
