        <p>Hi, my name is Adam Dressel. I am a software engineering student at Florida Gulf Coast University.
          I am an aspiring software developer excited about learning new tehniques and improving my skills as a programmer.
      I grew up in the SW florida area, born and raised in Cape Coral, FL. If my parents had a basement I would fit the nerdy computer guy stereotype to a T.
      In my free time I love playing video games and reading. I am constantly looking for ways to improve and work very well on my own and with others.
          I think I would be an excellent asset to a company's dev team. Looking for more? My contact information can be found below as well as any work samples you'd like to take a look at.
      I look forward to being in touch!</p>
